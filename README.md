## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction

2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
If requirements.txt is not included, install manually:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

4. Run the notebook
jupyter notebook House_Price_Prediction.ipynb

## 📊 Results
Trained and compared multiple models

Visualization of predicted vs actual prices

Key insights from EDA on important factors affecting prices

## 📈 Future Work
Add deep learning models

Deploy as a web app (Flask/Django/Streamlit)

Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy
